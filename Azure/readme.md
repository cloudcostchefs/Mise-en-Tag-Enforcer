üç≥ CloudCostChefs Recipe: Essential Tags Policy
No enterprise bloat. No complex setup. Just tag enforcement that works.

This recipe deploys an Azure Policy that enforces 4 essential tags on all resource groups:

Environment (Production, Development, Test, Staging)
Owner (Team or individual responsible)
CostCenter (For billing allocation)
Application (Workload identification)
üöÄ Quick Start (PowerShell - Recommended)
Prerequisites
Azure PowerShell module installed
Logged into Azure (Connect-AzAccount)
Policy Contributor role at target scope
1. Download the Script
powershell
# Download directly from GitHub or save the PowerShell script as Deploy-EssentialTagsPolicy.ps1
2. Deploy to Management Group
powershell
# Replace 'your-mg-id' with your management group ID
./Deploy-EssentialTagsPolicy.ps1 -Scope ManagementGroup -ScopeId "your-mg-id"
3. Deploy to Subscription
powershell
# Replace 'your-subscription-id' with your subscription ID
./Deploy-EssentialTagsPolicy.ps1 -Scope Subscription -ScopeId "your-subscription-id"
4. Test First (Recommended)
powershell
# Dry run to see what would happen
./Deploy-EssentialTagsPolicy.ps1 -Scope Subscription -ScopeId "your-subscription-id" -WhatIf
Advanced Options
powershell
# Custom tags and audit mode
./Deploy-EssentialTagsPolicy.ps1 `
  -Scope Subscription `
  -ScopeId "your-subscription-id" `
  -Effect "Audit" `
  -RequiredTags @("Environment", "Owner", "Project") `
  -AssignmentName "my-custom-policy"
üñ±Ô∏è Manual Deployment (Azure Portal)
If you prefer clicking buttons (we don't judge), here's how:

Step 1: Create Policy Definition
Navigate to Azure Policy
Go to Azure Portal ‚Üí Search "Policy" ‚Üí Select "Policy"
Create Definition
Click "Definitions" ‚Üí "Policy definition" ‚Üí "+ Policy definition"
Fill in Details
Definition location: Select your Management Group or Subscription
Name: require-essential-tags-resource-groups
Display name: Require Essential Tags on Resource Groups
Category: Create new ‚Üí Governance
Copy Policy Rule
Copy the entire content from essential-tags-policy.json
Paste into the "Policy rule" text box
Click "Save"
Step 2: Assign the Policy
Create Assignment
Go to "Assignments" ‚Üí "+ Assign policy"
Assignment Details
Scope: Select your Management Group or Subscription
Policy definition: Search for "Require Essential Tags on Resource Groups"
Assignment name: essential-tags-policy
Configure Parameters
Effect: Choose "Deny" (or "Audit" for testing)
Required Tags: Leave default or customize
Review and Create
Click "Review + create" ‚Üí "Create"
üéØ What This Does
‚úÖ ALLOWS (Compliant Resource Groups)
bash
# Resource group with all required tags
az group create \
  --name "myapp-prod-rg" \
  --location "eastus" \
  --tags Environment=Production Owner=platform-team CostCenter=engineering Application=web-app
‚ùå BLOCKS (Non-Compliant Resource Groups)
bash
# Missing tags - will be denied
az group create \
  --name "random-rg" \
  --location "eastus"
  # ERROR: Resource group must have all required tags
üîß Customization
Change Required Tags
Edit the requiredTags parameter in the script:

powershell
-RequiredTags @("Environment", "Owner", "Project", "Team")
Audit Mode (Non-Blocking)
Start with audit mode to see compliance without blocking:

powershell
-Effect "Audit"
Different Enforcement Levels
Deny: Block non-compliant resources (recommended)
Audit: Report violations but allow creation
Disabled: Turn off the policy
üìä Monitoring Compliance
PowerShell
powershell
# Check policy compliance
Get-AzPolicyState | Where-Object {$_.PolicyDefinitionName -eq "require-essential-tags-resource-groups"}
Azure Portal
Go to Azure Policy ‚Üí Compliance
Find your "Essential Tags Policy" assignment
View compliant vs non-compliant resources
üîç Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Access Denied"

Ensure you have Policy Contributor role
Check if targeting the right Management Group/Subscription
"Policy not taking effect"

Wait up to 30 minutes for evaluation cycle
Try creating a test resource group
"Tags not being enforced on resources"

This policy only enforces tags on Resource Groups
Resources inherit tags from Resource Groups (enable tag inheritance)
Quick Fixes
powershell
# Check your permissions
Get-AzRoleAssignment | Where-Object {$_.SignInName -eq (Get-AzContext).Account.Id}

# Validate policy assignment
Get-AzPolicyAssignment -Name "essential-tags-policy"

# Force policy evaluation (if needed)
Start-AzPolicyComplianceScan
üéâ Success Metrics
After deployment, you should see:

‚úÖ 100% of new resource groups have required tags
‚úÖ Clear cost allocation in Azure Cost Management
‚úÖ Easy resource identification and ownership
‚úÖ Improved governance and compliance scores
üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps
Enable Tag Inheritance: Apply resource group tags to child resources
Set up Cost Allocation: Use tags in Azure Cost Management
Automate Tag Application: Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/ARM)
Create Tag Policies for Resources: Extend beyond resource groups
